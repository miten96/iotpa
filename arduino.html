                    <p> Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.  </p>
                    <p> Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.  </p>
                    <p> Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Home Automation </h2>
                    <p> This is an open source system for integrating wireless Arduino sensors to an awesome home automation platform called OpenHAB.  It allows you to get email notifications and audio alarming based on sensor data.  The OpenHAB platform provides the mobile app server, browser based interface, actions (emails, Android/Apple push notification services), and rules engine needed to do real home automation. </p>

                        how much functionality and flexibility can be packed into a single Arduino sensor, here is the parameters <br>
                        1) smoke & combustible gas <br>
                        2) motion <br>
                        3) fire <br>
                        4) sound (dog bark) <br>
                        5) light level <br>
                        6) temperature & humidity

                    <p>
                        you are going on a vacation for a week or so and are worried about your house plant at home.Here is a great project to under take a week before you head out for your vacation. Build yourself a plant monitoring and notification system with the following feature Monitor the Temperature,Light Value and Soil moisture value using dweet.io
                        OR using the new Amazon IoT service to log data to AWS - DynamoDB. Use AWS -SNS notification, to send out an email to yourself, so that you can inform your cousin/neighbor to quickly water the plant or check on your thermostat at home.

                    <p>
                        Actually, many of us may suffer or afraid from being his car stolen. In this project, we will try to help you to protect your cars and even control them remotely.
                    <p>Basically, you have to leave a mobile phone in your car and when the car starts to move it uses its sensors to detect that and will send to you a message on your mobile phone where ever you are. Then, you can send a message to stop the car immediately so the thief couldn't turn it on again as well you can send another message to know its location using GPS to get it from there.</p>
                    <p>All of these can be implemented so easily and requires no experience in coding. All you need is Arduino, any Android smart phone and 1Sheeld that connects the mobile and Arduino via Bluetooth and make use of its mobile app, so no need for Android coding.</p>
